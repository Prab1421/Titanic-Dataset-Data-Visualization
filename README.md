## About Titanic
RMS Titanic, during her maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. The tragedy is considered one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history and led to better safety guidelines for ships.

## Dataset Information
This visualization analyzes the Titanic dataset, which includes details of 891 passengers. The dataset examines relationships between the following categorical features:
- Passenger Survival
- Seat/Berth class of passengers
- Sex of Passengers
- Port of Embarkation

## Visualization Details
This project visualizes the dataset using **D3.js** and **Dimple.js**, creating interactive charts that depict the relationships between these features. 

### Key Findings
- Overall, 65% of the passengers were males, while 35% were females.
- There were 44% females in I-class, but only 29% in III-class.
- 74% of the females survived, as compared to only 19% of the males.
- Overall, the survival rate was 38%.
- While 63% of I-Class passengers survived, only 24% from III-Class could make it.
- 94% of the passengers embarking from Queenstown reserved III-class, while 51% of the passengers embarking from Cherbourg reserved I-class.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For structuring and styling the visualization
- **D3.js**: Data-driven document manipulation
- **Dimple.js**: Simplified charting library for D3.js
